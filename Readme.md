## 🤔 What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block contains a list of transactions and is cryptographically linked to the previous one, ensuring transparency and security without needing a central authority.

## 🌐 What is Web3?

Web3 refers to the next evolution of the internet — a decentralized web powered by blockchain technology. It aims to give users ownership and control of their digital assets, data, and identities without intermediaries like banks or corporations.

## 🖼️ What is an NFT?

An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, NFTs are not interchangeable. They can represent digital art, music, in-game items, or even real-world assets, with proof of ownership and authenticity secured on-chain.

## 🚀 What We Are Doing

We are creating our own NFT and deploying it on a **blockchain testnet** for experimentation and learning purposes. This includes:
- Writing a smart contract using Solidity
- Minting a sample NFT
- Uploading its metadata and image to IPFS
- Testing the NFT on a blockchain test network
- Viewing the NFT on platforms like OpenSea (testnet)

## 🔧 Why These Tools and Standards?

### ✅ Why Solidity?

Solidity is the primary programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is widely adopted, well-documented, and compatible with major tools and frameworks in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### ✅ Why OpenZeppelin?

OpenZeppelin is a library of secure, community-vetted smart contract templates. It saves development time and reduces vulnerabilities by providing reusable, audited implementations of standards like ERC-721.

### ✅ Why ERC-721?

ERC-721 is the Ethereum standard for creating NFTs. It defines the rules and interface that NFT contracts should follow, ensuring compatibility with wallets, marketplaces, and other tools in the ecosystem.

### ✅ Why Remix IDE?

Remix is a browser-based IDE that simplifies the process of writing, compiling, and deploying Solidity contracts. It’s perfect for beginners and supports direct deployment to testnets like Goerli or Sepolia via MetaMask.

### ✅ Why OpenSea?

OpenSea is a popular NFT marketplace that also supports testnets. After deploying your NFT contract, you can see and interact with your test NFTs through OpenSea’s testnet interface.

### ✅ Why Pinata?

Pinata is a service that makes it easy to upload and manage files on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Since NFT metadata and images should be stored in a decentralized way, IPFS is ideal — and Pinata helps bridge that gap with a user-friendly experience.
